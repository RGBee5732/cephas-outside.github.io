		<p>hi idk what i'm doing lol<br>
		i just barely missed the deadline for my careers assignment yesterday<br>
		i finished writing at like 11:59:54 or smt when the assignment was due 11:59:59<br>
		i still had to export and merge pdfs and hand in n all that so i just missed it by a minute or 2<br>
		but my teacher said it was fine so that's cool<br><br>
		maybe i should have started earlier instead of procrastinating...</p>
