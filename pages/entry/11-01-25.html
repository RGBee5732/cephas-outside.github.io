		<p>coding this website sucks so bad.
			do you <em>know</em> how much it sucks trying to sift through 260 or so images,<br>
			copying EVERY. SINGLE. URL. and having to write a description for all of them???<br>
			why did i dig myself into this??<br><br>
			it's saturday today, can't wait to spend my entire day just copy pasting urls<br>
			 and trying to sort them into chronological order when i put them all into a server <br>
			 in a completely arbitrary order.<br>
			 damn you, 2022 RGBee!!!.
